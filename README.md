## Reason: Policy changes / Microsoft takes over


 "On 4 June 2018, GitHub was acquired by Microsoft. The same day many projects imported to GitLab."
 
[Wikipedia/GitLab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitLab)


 "We had quite a day on Monday with over 250k project imports - that got us a little backed up and proved to be a teaching moment in how we looked at our data models and patterns. We'll be through the backlog in about 3 hours (09:00 UTC)."
